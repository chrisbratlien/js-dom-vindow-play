A project to help me:
- babysit [DOM.js](DOM.js) with its newly removed dependence on jQuery.
- improve [Vindow.js](Vindow.js) which is new and needs more time in the game
- play with WebAudio API, build UI around its components
- keep the total size of `*.js` down with help from a pre-commit Git hook
